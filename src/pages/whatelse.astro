    <p>St. John's is a bucket list location for many people, and we hope you have the opportunity to enjoy the local area while you are here! Newfoundland is well known for its unique culture, heavily influenced by settlers from the British Isles, as well as its rugged and beautiful landscapes.  </p>
    <p>Here are some of our suggestions for making the most of your stay! </p>
    <h2>In St. John's</h2>
    <p><b>Signal Hill</b> is St. John's best known landmark, featuring Cabot Tower, built in commemoration of John Cabot's arrival in Newfoundland. The National Historic Site was the site of Marconi's first wireless transatlantic transmission in 1901. Offers great views of the city, harbour, and narrows, as well as Cape Spear in the distance. Most people drive up the hill, but it is technically possible to walk! </p>
    <p>At the foot of Signal Hill is <b>The Battery</b>, a neighbourhood of old-fashioned colourful homes that sit very close to the water. There is a hiking trail that will take you from Signal Hill to the Battery (we recommend going down, rather than up, unless you're looking to burn off all the toutons).</p>
    <p>Signal Hill also features the <b>Johnson Geo Centre</b>, a geographic museum built into the hillside.</p>
    <p>Pictures of St. John's almost always feature <b>Jelly Bean Row</b>, the generic name for the colourful houses found in the downtown core. While you can found these colourful houses in many locations, Gower Street is a great option if you want a colourful walk. It also has the benefit of being relatively flat (as you'll discover, downtown St. John's is very hilly!)</p>
    <p>One of the most prominent buildings in the St. John's skyline is <b>The Rooms</b>, the provincial museum and archive. The museum features a mix of stable exhibits on Newfoundland history and rotating exhibits of local art. The building also features a quite nice café and beautiful views of the city, which you can access without needing to pay an entry fee.</p>
    <p>During the summer, St. John's turns Water Street into a <b>Pedestrian Mall</b>. You'll find a wide variety of restaurants with outdoor seating along the road, as well as many local shops featuring locally produced goods. Duckworth street, just up from Water Street, also features many local shops that are worth poking your head into. </p>
    <p><b>Quidi Vidi</b> (pronounced kiddy viddy) is a traditional fishing village that has been subsumed into the St. John's metro area. Easily walkable from downtown, you can also drive there (though beware of traffic in the summer!). Grab a pint in the Quidi Vidi Brewery, check out the local crafts at the Artisan Studios, and grab a bite to eat at the Wharf, featuring a wide variety of food trucks. For a very classic Newfoundland experience, pop into the Inn of Olde.</p>
    <p>There is a lot of hiking available in the St. John's area. Parts of the East Coast trail will take you from Quidi Vidi to Signal Hill (and far beyond, if you were so inclined!). You'll also find some nice inner-city walking on the Rennie's River trail system and in Bowring Park. </p>
    <h2>Outside St. John's</h2>
    <p><b>Cape Spear</b> is another bucket list item when visiting Newfoundland. It's the furthest East you can go in North America, and also features some WWII fortifications and the Cape Spear Lighthouse. </p>
    <p>We highly recommend every get out on the water via a <b>Puffin/Whale Watching Tour</b>. July is the height of whale watching season here in Newfoundland, but we are also lucky to be a place where you can see puffins (which are absolutely guaranteed, unlike the whales). There are two companies that operate out of Bay Bulls, about 50 minutes outside of St. John's: Gatherall's and O'Brien's. They are pretty equivalent, though we've tended to use O'Brien's. You will need to book this in advance. </p>
    <p>Both O'Brien's and Gatherall's offer shuttle service to Bay Bulls if you don't have a car.</p>
    <p>Note: Iceberg Quest Ocean Tours leaves right from the St. John's Harbour, but they won't be able to take you all the way to the St. Mary's Ecological Preserve out in Bay Bulls, which is where you are guaranteed to be inundated with puffins.  </p>
    <h2>Where to Eat</h2>
    <p>St. John's has a pretty good food scene these days. These are just a few of our favourites. </p>
    <p><b>Birdie</b> has some of the best pastry around, bar none. Their triple chocolate croissants have converted people who don't like chocolate. Please go eat here. </p>
    <p><b>Johnny and Maes</b> have several food trucks around town, including at the Quidi Vidi Wharf. The burgers are massive; we recommend sharing with someone. Also be prepared for your hands to get a bit messy. </p>
    <p><b>Bagel Café</b>: Old School and popular with tourists and locals alike. All-day breakfast with a cozy and slightly chaotic atmosphere. </p>
    <p><b>The Parlour Gelato and Coffee</b>: Famous for their gelato, but also a good spot for pastries and coffee. Directly across from Bannerman Park and Government house if you wanted to go for a walk. </p>
    <p><b>The Postmaster's Bakery</b>: Popular spot for baked goods and coffee. Also has some savory options for breakfast and lunch, including Roman style pizza.</p>
    <p><b>Rocket Bakery</b>: Classic St. John’s bakery, with a good selection of sweet and savory options.</p>
    <h3>Upscale</h3>
    <p><b>Merchant Tavern</b>: Popular and often quite busy. Slightly more casual vibes, and *slightly* more affordable than Terre or Portage. Dinner only.</p>
    <p><b>Portage</b>: Rotating menu of local and seasonal foods. Generous portions and great for sharing with friends. Accessible fine dining. Dinner only. Delicious desserts made in house.</p>
    <p><b>Rabble</b>: The new restaurant from Todd Perrin, the former proprietor of Quidi Vidi's Mallard Cottage.** Intimate vibes with retro-inspired dishes. Have had very good experiences across the board. Slightly more affordable than Terre or Portage. Dinner only.</p>
    <p><b>Terre</b>: Rotating menu of local and seasonal foods. Famous for the chef's menu. Accessible but definitely fancy. Delicious Desserts made in house. Breakfast and lunch available in the café. *But also this is who's catering the wedding*</p>
    <h3>Mid-price</h3>
    <p><b>Adelaide Oyster House</b>: Oyster bar, alongside an asian-fusion menu </p>
    <p><b>Blue on Water</b>: Solid, upscale menu, more on the traditional side, but very accessible. Recent menus have not been the best for vegetarians, but lots of fish options.</p>
    <p><b>Gypsy Tea Room</b>: Solid menu with a good range of options (but I would skip dessert, which aren't made in house.)</p>
    <p><b>India Gate</b>: Excellent Indian food with a nice atmosphere. </p>
    <p><b>Piatto Pizzeria</b>: Wood-fired pizza; a local favourite! I wouldn't bother with the pasta—it just doesn't compare to the pizza—but the appetizers and burger are quite good. </p>
    <p><b>St. John's Fish Exchange</b>: Casual Upscale with a heavy emphasis on seafood.</p>
    <p><b>Vu Restaurant</b>: Wide lunch and dinner selections with great views of the St. John's Harbour. Slainté Whisky and Wine Bar is downstairs if you're looking for an evening tipple with live music.</p>
    <h3>Casual</h3>
    <p><b>Afghan Restaurant</b>: A tiny, family-run restaurant serving Afghan cuisine.</p>
    <p><b>Bannerman Brewery</b>: In the evenings, Bannerman switches from coffee to beer and a good mix of pub fare. Casual vibes, often with live music. </p>
    <p><b>Black Cat Pizzeria</b>: Excellent pizza; mostly take out, but some pizza available in store.</p>
    <p><b>Cajones</b>: Local chain serving pretty good Mexican food. </p>
    <p><b>Duke of Duckworth</b>: Classic pub; often in the running for best fish and chips.</p>
    <p><b>The Ship Pub and Kitchen</b>: Classic Newfoundland pub with regular live music and surprisingly good food.</p>
    <h3>Veggie/Vegan</h3>
    <p><b>Peaceful Loft</b>: Vegan Chinese</p>
    <p><b>Poyo // The Sprout</b>: Primarily vegan menu with a mexican lean</p>
    <p><b>Toslow</b>: Unique independent café open throughout the day with good amounts of vegan and vegetarian options.</p>
    <h2>Where not to Eat</h2>
    <p><b>Yellowbelly</b>: It used to be good, but now is pretty mediocre, and we've heard some horror stories from the kitchen. </p>
    <p><b>Estee</b>: As far as we can tell, this is some kind of money laundering front, and we're pretty sure their croissants are from Costco.</p>
